/*
     * 
        Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
        But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
        For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
       
        Sample output:

        1
        2
        Fizz
        4
        Buzz
        Fizz
        7
        8
        Fizz
        Buzz
        11
        Fizz
        13
        14
        FizzBuzz
        16
        17
        Fizz
        19
        Buzz
        ... etc up to 100

     * Program conditions:
     * Write a function that converts given number to correct string form.
     * Allowed numbers are 1-100. Anything below 1 or above 100 has undefined behavior.
